# Image-message #

## Description ##

Encode and decode message into and from an image.

This is a prototype based on the work from the following:

[Encoding Messages into an Image](http://lucascozby.com/2015/09/15/encoding-messages-into-an-image/)

Obviously this is not for production use.

**This project is no longer being maintained.**

## Requirements ##

* Node.js (`>=4.1.1`).
* GraphicsMagick (`>=1.3.21`).

## Installation ##

0. Install Node.js.
1. Install GraphicsMagick.
2. Run `encode.js` to encode message into an image and `decode.js` to decode
   message from an image.

## Usage ##

Check and make modifications to `encode.js` and `decode.js`, otherwise both
programs are very likely not going to work. A lot of assumptions were being made
when coding this prototype, including the path and dimension of the original
image.
